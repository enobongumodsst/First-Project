    <h2>Game's Features:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The A.I. on both offense and defense has CPU-controlled players acting and performing as authentically as they ever have in any 2K game.</li>
        <li>The new movement system takes away the heavy use of elongated, canned animations, but it doesn't sacrifice the natural flow that has always made NBA 2K so attractive on the screen.</li>
        <li>The biggest addition to this year's game is The Neighborhood. The MyCareer mode is now an open-world, MMO experience that amalgamates Pro-Am, MyPark, character customization and some new elements that hadn't been included before.</li>
      </ul>
